# bot_saves_princess

## Summary:
This repo is a code challange submission for two Hackerrank challenges. It includes a class, two separate files with the 'answer' function for each challenge in them, two fully complete solution files for use with the upload fature, and a basic test suit for the class needed. The challanges that this solves for can be found here ([Bot Saves Princess](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/saveprincess)) and here ([Bot Saves Princess 2](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/saveprincess2)).

## Bot Saves Princess:
In order to run the provided solution within the Hackerrank interface, please navigate [here](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/saveprincess). 

From here there are two options on how to proceed, please follow the instructions below for your preferred approach.

Pasting approach:
- Please select 'Ruby' from the drop down menu on the right hand side of the Hackerrank editor.
- Copy the function (excluding the 'require' line at the top) found in this repo under 'displayPathtoPrincess.rb'.
- Within the Hankerrank editor, replace lines 3 through 5 with the copied code. (If there is already code within the editor not provided by the challenge itself, reloading the page may clear it. If it does not, opening the page in an incognito window will provide a blank slate.)
- Copy the entire class found within this repo under 'lib/grid.rb'
- Somewhere above where the function is called on the last line, paste the class code into the editor. (I recommend pasting it either on line 14 and adding the needed blank lines around it, or pasting it drectly below the defined function.)
- The code within 'solution_upload_files/displayPathtoPrincess_complete_upload_file.rb' can also be copied, but please ensure that the entirety of the code within the Hackerrank editor is replaced by the contents of this file before continuing. **Doing this step replaces steps 3 through 5 above.**
- Below the editor, click 'run code', and then press the 'play' button in the interface that appears below. Congrats! We saved the princess.

Using files:
- For this approach, we need the file named 'displayPathtoPrincess_complete_upload_file.rb' found in the 'solution_upload_files' folder within this repo.
- Find this file within this repo, download it, and save it somewhere it will be easy to find.
- Within the Hackerrank interface, select 'Upload Code as File' below the editor, upload the file, and select 'Ruby' as the language.
- After the code from our file has appeared in the editor, select 'run code', and then press the 'play' button in the interface that appears below. Congrats! We saved the princess.
